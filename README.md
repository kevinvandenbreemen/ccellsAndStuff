# ccellsAndStuff
Simple C programming project to play with arrays

# Setup

## Building
Simply use the makefile.  Run run the program type make run

## Unit Tests
I developed this on an Ubuntu machine.  I tried to add a check to the Makefile for the requisite "Check" library.  If it fails you can run 

```
sudo apt-get install check
```

on your Ubuntu box.

### Further help on "check" library

I followed https://stackoverflow.com/a/54095032/2328196 to get myself up and running.
